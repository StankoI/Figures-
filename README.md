The 2D Figures Program is a C++ application that allows users to create and manage 2D geometric figures (Triangle, Circle, Rectangle) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and essential data structures.

Features
Figure Creation: Generate figures randomly, via user input (STDIN), or from a file.
Perimeter Calculation: Compute and display the perimeter of each figure.
Figure Management: List, delete, duplicate, and save figures to a file.
Immutability: Figures cannot be modified after creation.
Extensible Design: Easily add or remove figure types and input methods.
Technical Details
OOP Concepts: Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Data Structures:
std::vector for dynamic figure storage.
std::unordered_map 
Smart pointers for safe memory management.
File streams for input/output operations.
Usage
Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the program and choose how to create figures (random, input, or file).
Manage figures: list, delete, duplicate, or save to a file.
